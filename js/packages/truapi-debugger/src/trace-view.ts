 * A {@link WireTrace} is the *engine* contract: raw {@link ObservedFrame}s
 * grouped by `requestId`. The drill-down UI is mounted in two places with
 * structurally different taps behind them:
 *
 *  - the standalone app taps the raw wire (numeric `frameId`, `byteLength`,
 *    optional `bytes`), and resolves method names through the wire table;
 *  - dotli's panel taps the post-decode host-container bridge, so it has a
 *    method `tag` and a decoded payload but no wire discriminant or byte count.
 *
 * A single renderer over raw {@link WireTrace} would force one of those two to
 * fake the other's fields. {@link TraceView} is the honest shared surface: a
 * normalized per-op view both vantages can populate, with vantage-specific
 * fields left optional. {@link wireTraceToView} is the wire-vantage adapter;
 * dotli ships its own adapter over the same shape.
 *
 * The `WireTrace`/envelope/level-2 contract is unchanged by this module: it
 * only reads a `WireTrace` and produces a view.

 *  - `orphaned`: the trace has an opening frame with no matching close - a request
 *    with no response, a subscribe with no receive. Opener-only, deliberately: an
 *    operator reads this as "the host never answered", so the two closer-side
 *    shapes below must not borrow it.
 *  - `unpaired`: a closing frame with no opener observed at all. Usually not a
 *    host fault - the op began before the debugger attached, or its opener's frame
 *    id is off this debugger's table.
 *  - `malformed`: at least one frame failed to decode on the wire.
 *  - `retry-storm`: the op is one of a burst of like ops in a short window.
 *    This is a *cross-op* signal the single-trace renderer cannot see on its
 *    own, so it is supplied by the caller (the list/engine layer) rather than
 *    derived here. Left as a follow-up for the engine to compute.
 *  - `truncated`: older frames of this op were dropped to stay under the engine's
 *    frame/byte cap, so the sequence shown is not the whole op. How many, and
 *    which cap took them, is in {@link TraceView.dropped}. Because the dropped
 *    frames may be the ones that answered the opener, a truncated op does not

 * Second pass over the frame sequence: pair openers with closers to fill in

 * All frames of a trace share one `requestId`, so pairing is positional: each
 * closing frame answers the most recent opener. An opener that never got any
 * close is orphaned (a request with no response, a subscribe that never
 * delivered); a closer with no opener before it is orphaned. An opener that got
 * at least one close is not orphaned even if it stays open - a live
 * subscription (start + receives, no stop yet) is healthy, not dropped.
 *
 * `framesEvicted` says frames are missing from this sequence because a retention
 * cap dropped them. Caps spare the OPENER, wherever it sits - not index 0, which
 * may itself be evicted when the opener arrived later. So the opener is still here
 * but the frames around it may not be: "no close was observed" no longer implies
 * "no close happened", and openers are left unflagged rather than blamed for the
 * engine's own eviction.
 *
 * A closer with no opener is NOT called `orphaned`. Three different situations
 * produce one, and none of them means "the host never answered":
 *
 *   1. Whole-op LRU eviction (`maxTraces`) dropped the trace outright, and a later
 *      closer for the same id revived it with no opener. The debugger's own
 *      retention caused it.
 *   2. The opener was never observed at all, because the op began before the tap
 *      attached - the cold start of both mounts.
 *   3. A duplicate close: `openStack.pop()` fires on the first terminal close, so
 *      a second response, or a `receive` still in flight when the `stop` landed,
 *      finds an empty stack.
 *
 * All three earn `unpaired`, which is true of every one of them and accuses
 * nobody. They are NOT distinguishable from here: `matched` looks like it separates
 * 3 (an opener was answered, so one existed) but it is trace-global, so in a trace
 * holding more than one op it also fires for 1 and 2. Separating a real
 * double-answer from an unobserved opener needs per-opener provenance that
 * positional pairing does not carry.
 *
 * Two known gaps left, both needing engine state this file cannot see:
 *   - A trace revived per route 1 reports `generation: 0`, so a recycled id's later
 *     op looks like its first.
 *   - A genuine double-answer (a real host defect) is reported only as `unpaired`,
 *     indistinguishable from the benign cold-start case.
