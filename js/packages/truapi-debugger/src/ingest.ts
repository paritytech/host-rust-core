 *   regardless. The digest is computed arithmetically, so nothing references the
 *   input.
 *  - Identity. Two distinct ids sharing a `maxChars` prefix truncate to the same
 *   key and merge into one trace, fabricating a `roundTripMs` between two
 *   unrelated ops and clearing a genuinely `orphaned` badge. Distinct ids digest
 *   to distinct keys.
 *
 * Rejecting the frame instead would take the op dark, which is the opposite of
 * the ingest's own rule for input it cannot use (an undecodable frame becomes a
 * `"malformed"` sentinel, never a drop), and it would discard legitimate frames
 * from any host whose ids are merely long. The digest keeps the op observable
 * and correlatable while bounding what is retained.
