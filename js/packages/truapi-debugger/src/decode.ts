 * Level-2 decode: turn a frame's raw SCALE payload into a plain JS value, in the

 * This is the one place the debugger looks *inside* a frame. Everything else -
 * the trace engine, `/traces`, the host tap - is payload-blind and stays that
 * way. The rules that make that work live here:
 *
 *  - **Dev-only tool: decode everything.** This debugger decodes every frame it
 *    can, with no "sensitive" special-casing. A developer inspecting their own
 *    session's traffic sees the real values. When decoding is disabled every
 *    frame reports its byte length only.
 *  - **Reuse, don't reinvent.** Decoding is `WIRE_DECODE_TABLE[frameId]?.(bytes)`
 *    from `@parity/truapi/wire-decode` - the same generated, dev-only codecs the
 *    client uses. The debugger writes no codecs of its own.
 *
 * Nothing here is ever serialized into `/traces`; the detail it produces is
 * returned only from the explicit per-frame drill-down.
