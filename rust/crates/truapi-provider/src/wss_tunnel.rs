//! Loopback TLS tunnels that make `/wss` bootnodes reachable on native targets.
//!
//! smoldot's native platform declines secure WebSocket:
//! `DefaultPlatform::supports_connection_type` omits
//! `ConnectionType::WebSocketDns { secure: true }` above a `TODO: support
//! WebSocket secure`, and `connect_stream` only matches `secure: false`. A chain
//! whose bootnodes are all `/wss` therefore never dials one — the network logs
//! `reason=no-address`, discovery reports `discovery-skipped-no-peer`, and warp
//! sync sits on the chain-spec checkpoint forever, so every read times out.
//!
//! Browsers are unaffected, which is why the same chain specs work in a page:
//! the wasm platform delegates to the browser's own `WebSocket`, and that speaks
//! TLS. Only the native platform has to terminate TLS itself.
//!
//! [`tunnel_wss_bootnodes`] rewrites each `/wss` bootnode to a `/ws` address on
//! a loopback listener that relays to the real host over TLS.
//!
//! The relay is not byte-for-byte. smoldot derives the WebSocket `Host` header
//! from the address it dials, so a rewritten address would send
//! `Host: 127.0.0.1:<port>` upstream, and a bootnode behind name-based virtual
//! hosting answers that with 404 or 403 rather than an upgrade. The relay
//! therefore rewrites that one header back to the real authority before
//! forwarding, and copies every later byte untouched.
//!
//! Only the transport is terminated: the libp2p noise handshake travels inside
//! the WebSocket frames, so the remote peer id is still authenticated end to end
//! and a tampering tunnel would fail the handshake rather than go unnoticed.
//! That argument only holds for an address that carries a peer id, so
//! [`tunnel_address`] declines any bootnode without one.
//!
//! Remove this module once smoldot's native platform supports secure WebSocket;
//! the only caller is the `add_chain` path in [`crate::light`].
